Flutter wrapper for [MetricKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metrickit) on iOS and macOS.

## Overview

`flutter_metric_kit` provides a Dart interface to Apple's MetricKit, allowing
Flutter apps to collect and analyze advanced performance and diagnostics metrics
from iOS and macOS devices. This plugin is useful for monitoring app
performance, resource usage, and crash diagnostics in production environments.

## Features

- Collects a wide range of metrics, including:
  - CPU, memory, GPU, and disk I/O usage
  - App launch and responsiveness metrics
  - Animation and display performance
  - Network transfer statistics
  - Location activity and cellular condition metrics
  - Signpost and custom event metrics
  - Crash and hang diagnostics
  - Device and app metadata
- Provides strongly-typed Dart models for all MetricKit payloads
- Supports JSON serialization for easy storage and analysis
- Designed for extensibility and maintainability
